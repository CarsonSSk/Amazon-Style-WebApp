Navigating the cart page

The cart must be opened by clicking a cart button in the top right corner of the screen, which is visible from any front-store page (ex: home page, product page, browsing page, etc.).
At all times, the cart button will have a badge showing the number of items currently in the cart.

From the cart window, a list of items currently in the cart is visible. Each item is displayed in the same amount of space, with divider lines separating the items.
At the left of each item space, a square image of the item is shown.
The item name is displayed in bold text next to the image.

To the right of the item name, the unit price of the item is shown.
Next to the unit price, there is a field to modify the quantity of the item to be purchased.
If the quantity selected is greater than the seller of the item has in stock, a warning will pop-up indicating the maximum quantity of the item available.

Next to the quantity, the subtotal price of the item is shown.
When the quantity of an item is modified, the item subtotal updates accordingly (as well as the overall cart subtotal).

Each item in the cart has a "Remove" button to remove the item from the cart.

At the bottom of the item list, the subtotal (price before tax) is shown. Below the subtotal, there is a "Proceed to checkout" button.
Upon clicking "Proceed to checkout", the customer is taken to the checkout page, where they enter payment and shipping information to complete their order.
